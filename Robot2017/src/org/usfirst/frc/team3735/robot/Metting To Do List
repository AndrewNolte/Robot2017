To Test:
	
	test driving and make sure the clean up didn't fuck up anything
	optimize moving and turning values so it doesn't jitter
	see if slow reverse driving is a code problem or mechanical
	
	test and optimize the new dropoff sequence
		test if the command will finish on its own by putting it on smartdashboard
	test the new vision setup by testing side auto
		test if making a gear filter will slow down and mess up the peg one
	test new values for accel in DriveMoveDistanceExpNavx
	record bumping values, set them, and test the new bump stop on the DMD vision command
	calibrate sensitivity and equation for driving in a circle
		then test in an auto routine
	test the three different shooter speeds for the pov buttons instead of different agitator speeds
	test the drive move distance that slows down until stopped after doing the normal drive thing
	test the spin move buttons
