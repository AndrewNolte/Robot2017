To Test:
	
	test if making a gear filter will slow down and mess up the peg one
	test new values for accel in DriveMoveDistanceExpNavx
	calibrate sensitivity and equation for driving in a circle
		then test in an auto routine
	test the drive move distance that slows down until stopped after doing the normal drive thing
	test the spin move buttons
		
To Make:
	pattern classes for saving a pattern of two vision rectangles, including translation ratios, height ratios,
	and width ratios, which gives out a percent match.
	the vision class would select the one with the best match, or have a certain threshold match
